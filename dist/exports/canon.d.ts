 * A fallible Canonizer for mapping objects to primitive versions to allow comparison by value.

 * Arrays and objects are mapped to a stringification that digs into objects to a level defined by `maxDepth`, or 2 if `maxDepth` is not provided.
 * Dates are mapped to `"Date: "` plus their numeric value as milliseconds from epoch.
 *
 * @param {K} lookup The key to canonize.

 * @returns A canonized version of the lookup. Not necessarily a string but guaranteed to be a primitive.

 * Map with canonized keys.
 * By instantiating a Map with a canonizer function, we can execute lookups according to an arbitrary notion of key identity.
 * For example, we can use arrays as Map indices and treat arrays with the same members as equivalent.
 *
 * @remarks
 * In use cases that call for Maps, developers will often want to map by some combination of values instead of a single value.
 * If they use an object or array for this, however, lookups won't work because objects or arrays are compared by reference rather than value.
 * The solution is to initialize the map with a "canonizer" that, for any key, creates a canonical equivalent that other referentially unique objects and arrays can map to.
 *
 * This gives the user total control over the equality algorithm. Under the hood, CanonMap maintains a Map between canonized keys and values. As far as TypeScript's type system is concerned, though, it is a Map from the desired key type to the desired value type that just happens to compare by equality.
